The error indicates that Flask cannot locate your application, and as a result, the `flask db migrate` command fails. To resolve this, you need to ensure that Flask knows where to find your application by setting the `FLASK_APP` environment variable.

### Steps to resolve:

1. **Set `FLASK_APP` Environment Variable**:
   Since your main Flask application is in `main.py`, you should set `FLASK_APP` to `main.py`.

   You can do this in two ways depending on your shell:

   - For **bash/zsh** (Mac/Linux):
     ```bash
     export FLASK_APP=main.py
     ```

   - For **Windows** (Command Prompt):
     ```bash
     set FLASK_APP=main.py
     ```

2. **Retry the migration command**:
   After setting the `FLASK_APP` environment variable, try running the migration again:

   ```bash
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

3. **Alternative approach using the `--app` option**:
   If you prefer not to set the environment variable, you can pass the `--app` option directly in the command:

   ```bash
   flask --app main.py db migrate
   flask --app main.py db upgrade
   ```

This should resolve the issue, and Flask should be able to locate your application. Let me know if you encounter any further problems!
